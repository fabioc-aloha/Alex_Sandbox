# ✅ QA Review Checklist

## Per-Scene Review

Use this checklist for EACH scene you localize.

- [ ] Gerunds converted to "a + infinitive" pattern
- [ ] Demonstratives adjusted (isso → isto where appropriate)
- [ ] Vocabulary matches pt-PT (cross-reference GLOSSARY.md)
- [ ] Expressions localized appropriately (reference/expressions.md)
- [ ] Contractions expanded where needed (pra → para a)

### Character Voice

- [ ] Personality preserved (sarcastic stays sarcastic, shy stays shy)
- [ ] Age-appropriate language (youth slang adapted, not lost)
- [ ] Social register maintained (formal/informal levels match original)
- [ ] Unique speech patterns adapted (tics, catchphrases, rhythm)

### Technical Formatting

### Cultural Adaptation

- [ ] Currency/measurements localized if relevant

### Timing & Flow
