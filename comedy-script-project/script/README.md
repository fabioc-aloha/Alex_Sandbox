## Page Count Guidelines

- **Target:** 90-120 pages
- **1 page ≈ 1 minute** of screen time
- **Comedy scripts** often run shorter (90-100 pages)
- **Dialogue-heavy** scenes read faster
- **Action-heavy** scenes may play longer than page count

---

## Comedy Writing Tips

1. **Read dialogue aloud** - Does it sound natural?
2. **Trim the fat** - Get to the joke faster
3. **End scenes on laughs** - When possible
4. **Subtext is funny** - What's NOT said
5. **Specific > Generic** - "Prius" funnier than "car"
