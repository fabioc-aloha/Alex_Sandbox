## Cold Open

```
[MAYA and DANNY at desk]

MAYA: This week, a church in Rome launched an official investigation
      after a restored angel was found to bear a striking resemblance
      to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

      The 80-year-old pensioner who did the restoration insists it's
      a coincidence.

DANNY: Sure. "I was just restoring it to its original form and
       ACCIDENTALLY made it look exactly like the most powerful
       woman in Italy."

MAYA: The Prime Minister responded on Instagram with: "No, I
      definitely do not look like an angel."

      Which is the most politician non-denial denial I've ever heard.

## Headlines Block 1

### Story 1: The Angel That Looks Like Meloni

**Source:** The Guardian - Feb 1, 2026
**Lead:** Maya

```
[GRAPHIC: "WHEN ANGELS LOOK SUSPICIOUSLY FAMILIAR"]

MAYA: Our top story: In Rome, Italy's culture minister and the
      Diocese of Rome have launched investigations after a restored
      angel in the Basilica of St. Lawrence was discovered to look
      EXACTLY like Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

DANNY: I've seen the before and after photos. That's not a restoration.
       That's a TRANSFORMATION.

MAYA: The newspaper La Repubblica reported that before the restoration,
      there was — quote — "a generic cherub."

      And now there's "the face of the most powerful woman in Italy."

DANNY: The 80-year-old pensioner who did the work insists it's
       a coincidence.

MAYA: He said: "It's not Meloni. I restored the faces to how
      they were 25 years ago."

DANNY: Ah yes, 25 years ago. When Giorgia Meloni was... 23.
       And apparently, already an angel.

MAYA: The sacristan spent TWO YEARS on this restoration.
      That's a lot of time to accidentally paint the Prime Minister.

DANNY: The Vatican is reportedly concerned. The Diocese called it
       "unacceptable" that sacred images could be "misused or exploited."

MAYA: Although the sacristan did note one upside. Quote:
      "In the past years we've never seen so many people in this church."

DANNY: Tourism is UP, baby!

MAYA: Divine intervention works in mysterious ways.

DANNY: Quick hit from Ukraine: Despite ongoing power cuts caused
       by Russian attacks and freezing temperatures, residents of
       Kyiv threw a DANCE PARTY on a FROZEN RIVER.

       DJ booth. Speakers. The whole thing. On ice.

MAYA: Ukrainians continue to be the most resilient people on Earth.

DANNY: "We have no electricity and it's negative 20 degrees."
       "Cool, let's RAVE."

**Lead:** Danny

```
[GRAPHIC: "COMPETITIVE CAPYBARA BATHING"]

DANNY: Maya. MAYA. I need to tell you about something beautiful.

MAYA: Is it animal-related?

DANNY: It's animal-related.

       In Japan, multiple zoos held a CAPYBARA BATHING COMPETITION.
       Called the "Long Bath Showdown."

       The winner? A capybara named PRUNE who stayed in the bath
       for OVER AN HOUR.

MAYA: I'm sorry, someone organized a competition to see which
      capybara could... sit in water the longest?

DANNY: MULTIPLE zoos, Maya. This was a COORDINATED EVENT.

MAYA: And the capybara's name is Prune.

DANNY: Because he was IN the bath for so long. Get it? Pruney?

MAYA: I... do get it. I'm just processing that this is news.

DANNY: Prune is a CHAMPION, Maya. Show some respect.

MAYA: Congratulations to Prune.

DANNY: Thank you.

MAYA: For doing literally nothing.

DANNY: For doing it BEST.

MAYA: Moving on.

### Story 3: The Maserati Movie Madness

**Source:** The Guardian - Feb 1, 2026
**Lead:** Maya

```
[GRAPHIC: "60 FAKE MASERATIS (BUT LIKE, FANCY FAKE)"]

MAYA: A new movie about the Maserati car company has built
      SIXTY replica 1920s and 1930s Maseratis for the film.

      The budget? Over 90 million pounds.

DANNY: That's... a lot of money for fake cars.

MAYA: The film stars Anthony Hopkins, Al Pacino, Andy García,
      and Jessica Alba, telling the story of the Maserati brothers
      who started the company in a garage in Bologna.

DANNY: Starting a car company in a garage. The original startup bros.

MAYA: The cars have modern engines but recreate the original sounds.

DANNY: Wait, they built sixty cars that SOUND like they're from 1930
       but actually run on modern technology?

MAYA: Correct.

DANNY: So it's like when I play vinyl records through my Bluetooth speaker.

MAYA: It is absolutely not like that.

DANNY: The VIBES are accurate, Maya.

MAYA: The director said Hopkins was "really artistically involved"
      and even rewrote some of his own lines.

DANNY: Anthony Hopkins: 86 years old, two Oscars, and still doing rewrites.

MAYA: Legend behavior.

## Segment: "Around the World in 80 Seconds"

*International quick hits segment*

```
[GRAPHIC: "AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 SECONDS"]
[GLOBE SPINNING ANIMATION]

MAYA: It's time for Around the World in 80 Seconds.
      Let's see what else is happening internationally.

[GRAPHIC: "ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"]
DANNY: In England, a TWO-YEAR-OLD has broken two Guinness World
       Records for playing pool and snooker. He's not even three yet.

MAYA: I have been playing pool for 20 years and I'm worse than a toddler.

[GRAPHIC: "BELARUS 🇧🇾"]
DANNY: In Belarus, customs officials discovered a RACCOON that had
       stowed away in a car shipped from the United States.

MAYA: That raccoon saw what was happening in America and said,
      "Belarus it is."

[GRAPHIC: "AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺"]
DANNY: In Australia, the opposition party is being compared to
       "Days of Our Lives" due to all the political drama.

MAYA: Which is fitting because Australian politics is ALSO
      something I put on when I need background noise.

[GRAPHIC: "NORWAY 🇳🇴"]
DANNY: And Norway's crown princess is in the headlines for
       having years of contact with Jeffrey Epstein.

MAYA: We're not going to joke about that one.

DANNY: Nope. Moving on.

[END GLOBE ANIMATION]

## Headlines Block 2

**Lead:** Danny

[GRAPHIC: "THIS TODDLER IS BETTER THAN YOU"]

DANNY: Okay, we mentioned this in the segment but I need to
       give it the full story because it's UNHINGED.

       A two-year-old in England — not even three — has broken
       TWO Guinness World Records.

       One for pool. One for snooker.

MAYA: What was I doing at two years old?

DANNY: Learning to walk, presumably.

MAYA: This kid is running tables.

DANNY: He can't tie his shoes, but he can make a bank shot.

MAYA: The video shows him on a step stool at the table, barely
      able to see over the edge, sinking balls like a tiny hustler.

DANNY: Somewhere there's a pool hall full of grown men who
       just got dunked on by a toddler.

MAYA: "I lost my rent money to someone in a Pull-Up."

DANNY: "He didn't even trash talk. He just asked for more juice."

### Quick Hit: The Emu That Stopped British Transit

**Source:** UPI - Jan 23, 2026

```
[GRAPHIC: "DELAYED DUE TO: EMU"]

MAYA: Quick hit from England: Train service between Hull and
      Liverpool was interrupted by an escaped emu on the tracks.

      British Rail called it an "unexpected wildlife delay."

DANNY: I would call it the most British sentence ever written.

MAYA: "Apologies for the delay. There is an emu."

DANNY: "The 8:15 to Liverpool will be delayed due to: bird."

### Story 5: Greenland's Prime Minister vs. Trump

**Source:** The Guardian - Jan 31, 2026
**Lead:** Maya

```
[GRAPHIC: "GREENLAND: 'WE'RE NOT FOR SALE' (AGAIN)"]

MAYA: In international diplomacy news, Greenland's Prime Minister
      is gaining fans after repeatedly telling Donald Trump that
      Greenland is not for sale.

DANNY: This is a conversation we've had before, right?

MAYA: Multiple times. In 2019 and now again.

DANNY: So Trump looked at Greenland and said, "I'll take it."
       And Greenland said, "No."
       And Trump said, "How about now?"
       And Greenland said, "Still no."

MAYA: The Prime Minister has been described as "under pressure"
      but has gained supporters both at home and abroad for
      standing firm.

DANNY: I respect anyone whose entire job has become saying
       "no" to the same question over and over.

MAYA: That's called being a parent.

DANNY: Or working retail.

MAYA: "Can I buy Greenland?" "No." "What if I—" "NO."

DANNY: Customer service training really prepared this guy.

### Rapid Fire Quick Hits

```
[GRAPHIC: "FROZEN RIVER DANCE PARTY"]
DANNY: One more time for the Kyiv dance party: they put a DJ
       booth on a FROZEN RIVER. In a WAR ZONE. Iconic.

[GRAPHIC: "CHINA LIFTS SANCTIONS"]
MAYA: China lifted sanctions on six British MPs after Prime
      Minister Starmer's visit. Trump called the trip "very dangerous."
      Because apparently diplomacy is scary now.

[GRAPHIC: "COSMIC DUST LAB"]
DANNY: A Sydney lab is making COSMIC DUST from scratch to
       understand how life began on Earth. Which is either
       groundbreaking science or a very elaborate arts and crafts project.

[GRAPHIC: "SWISS BAR FIRE"]
MAYA: The death toll from a bar fire in Crans-Montana, Switzerland
      has risen to 41. We're not joking about that one either.
```

## Sign-Off

```
MAYA: That's all for our international edition.

DANNY: To recap: An angel in Rome looks like the Prime Minister,
       a capybara named Prune won a bath competition in Japan,
       someone built sixty fake Maseratis, a toddler is better at
       pool than all of us, and Ukraine is still finding time to party.

MAYA: The world is weird, folks.

DANNY: Beautifully, chaotically weird.

MAYA: I'm Maya Chen.

DANNY: And I'm Danny Okonkwo.

MAYA: See you next week.

DANNY: When we return to American chaos.

MAYA: It's not a competition.

DANNY: America would win anyway.

MAYA: Probably. Good night!

DANNY: Good night!
