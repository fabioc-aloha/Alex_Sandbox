## Cold Open

```
[HOSTS at desk]

MAYA: This week, the TSA released its list of most unusual
        items found at airport security in 2025. Number two
        on the list? Live turtles hidden in a woman's bra.

        Which I believe makes her the first person ever
        detained for having reptile dysfunction.

DANNY: [Stares] I hate you.

## Intro

```
MAYA: Good evening, I'm Maya Chen.

DANNY: And I'm Danny Okonkwo.

MAYA: Welcome to Fake News Weekly, where we bring you the
        week's most absurd news.

DANNY: Because 2026 is already unhinged and it's only January.

MAYA: Let's get into it.

## Headlines Block 1

### Story 1: The Crying Horse

**Source:** UPI - Jan 29, 2026
**Lead:** Host 1

```
[GRAPHIC: "CRYING HORSE TOY GOES VIRAL IN CHINA"]

MAYA: Our top story tonight: a stuffed horse toy in China
        has become a viral sensation because a manufacturing
        error made it look like it's crying.

        The factory accidentally sewed the muzzle upside-down,
        giving it a frown and making the nostrils look like
        falling tears.

        [Image of crying horse]

        And Chinese office workers have adopted it as their
        official mascot because — and this is a direct quote —
        "This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like
        the way I feel at work."

DANNY: Honestly? Relatable content.

MAYA: Sales went from 400 per day to TENS OF THOUSANDS
        after photos went viral.

        So remember, kids: if you make a mistake at work,
        just rebrand it as "a mood."

DANNY: That horse has my exact energy every Monday morning.

MAYA: The factory owner must be thrilled. "We screwed up
        the design." "Sir, you've captured the millennial
        condition."
```

MAYA:



DANNY:

### Quick Hit: Raccoon Diplomacy

```
[GRAPHIC: "RACCOON STOWS AWAY TO BELARUS"]

DANNY: Quick hit: Customs officials in Belarus discovered a
        raccoon hiding in a car shipped from the United States.

        Making this the first successful American emigration
        of 2026.

MAYA: That raccoon saw what was happening here and said
        "I'm out."
```

## Political Desk: "Charts & Crimes"

*Trump news segment - keeping it absurd*

### Story: Trump Declares "Liberation Day" for DC Crime That's... Already Down?

**Source:** BBC Verify - Jan 2026
**Lead:** Host 2

```
[GRAPHIC: "LIBERATION DAY (FROM THE FACTS)"]

DANNY: Okay, time for some political news. President Trump
        this week declared a "crime emergency" in Washington DC,
        deploying the National Guard to — and I quote —
        "rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed,
        bedlam, and squalor."

MAYA: That sounds bad!

DANNY: It would be, except — and this is wild — DC's violent
        crime is actually at a 30-YEAR LOW.

MAYA: I'm sorry?

DANNY: According to the city's own police department, violent
        crime fell 26% this year. Robbery is down 28%. Homicides
        are down 12%.

MAYA: So we're deploying the National Guard to fight...
        a problem that's actively getting better?

DANNY: Correct. It's like calling the fire department because
        your house ISN'T on fire.

MAYA: "Help! Everything is fine!"

DANNY: "Ma'am, calm down." "I CAN'T! IT'S SO CALM HERE!"
```

### Story: Trump's Love Affair with Charts

**Source:** BBC - Jan 2026 (tracking back to 2016)
**Lead:** Host 1

```
[GRAPHIC: "THE CHART WHISPERER"]

MAYA: Speaking of this week, can we talk about the charts?

DANNY: Oh, we HAVE to talk about the charts.

MAYA: So the BBC did a whole retrospective on President
        Trump's — and I'm quoting — "love for charts over
        the years."

        [Image: Trump holding a chart]

        The man LOVES a visual aid. He's been doing this
        since 2016.

DANNY: And they're always those giant poster-board charts
        with like one bar that's massive and all the other
        bars are tiny.

MAYA: The thing is, the numbers on the charts often don't
        match what's actually happening.

DANNY: Right, like the DC crime chart showed crime going UP
        when it's actually going DOWN.

MAYA: It's like if I made a chart showing I'm 6'2" and
        an Olympic athlete. The chart exists. It's just
        not connected to reality.

DANNY: "According to my chart, I'm incredibly handsome."

MAYA: "The chart doesn't lie."

DANNY: The chart ONLY lies.
```

### Quick Hit: Batman vs. ICE

```
[GRAPHIC: "NOT THE HERO WE EXPECTED"]

MAYA: Quick hit from the political desk: At a city council
        meeting about whether to assist ICE at the Super Bowl,
        a man dressed as Batman showed up to argue AGAINST
        cooperation.

        [Image reference: Man in Batman costume at podium]

DANNY: Wait, actual Batman costume?

MAYA: Full cowl. Cape. The whole thing.

DANNY: I mean, Batman IS an expert on vigilante justice,
        so technically he's a subject matter expert here.

MAYA: "I work outside the law, and even I think this is weird."

DANNY: Gotham City council meetings must be WILD.

### Story 2: Michigan State Police Capture Dolly Parton

**Source:** UPI - Jan 29, 2026
**Lead:** Host 2

```
[GRAPHIC: "MICHIGAN POLICE CAPTURE DOLLY PARTON"]

DANNY: In Michigan, state police were called to round up
        an escaped mini donkey.

        The donkey's name? Dolly Parton.

MAYA: [Beat] That tracks, honestly.

DANNY: Police successfully wrangled Dolly Parton and
        returned her to Oakland County.

        Which means Michigan State Police can now say
        they've worked with Dolly Parton, and they're
        not even lying.

MAYA: That donkey was just working 9 to 5.

DANNY: Trying to make a living...

MAYA: Just trying to get by.

DANNY: It's all taking, and no giving.

MAYA: Okay, we need to move on.
```

### Quick Hit: Texas Kangaroo

```
[GRAPHIC: "KANGAROO LOOSE IN TEXAS"]

MAYA: Quick hit: Police in Liberty County, Texas captured
        a kangaroo that was found hopping down the middle of
        the road.

        They still haven't found the owner.

        Which is insane because — and I cannot stress this
        enough — someone in Texas is just missing a kangaroo
        and apparently hasn't noticed.

DANNY: "Honey, have you seen Steve?" "Steve the WHAT?"
```

### Story 3: Semi Truck Spills Beer Kegs on Wisconsin Highway

**Source:** UPI - Jan 29, 2026
**Lead:** Host 1

```
[GRAPHIC: "BEER KEGS COVER WISCONSIN HIGHWAY"]

MAYA: A semitrailer crash in Wisconsin resulted in the
        highway being covered in kegs of New Glarus beer
        for several hours.

        [Image of kegs on highway]

DANNY: Oh no!

MAYA: I know.

DANNY: That's Wisconsin's GOOD beer!

MAYA: Locals described the scene as "devastating" and also
        "weirdly tempting."

        The highway was closed while cleanup crews collected
        the scattered kegs. Miraculously, no one stopped to
        "help."

DANNY: Wisconsin showed incredible restraint that day.

MAYA: The kegs were just rolling around. I'm sure no one
        thought about it.

DANNY: Not even once.

MAYA: Certainly not.
```

## Segment: "Animals Behaving Normally, Humans Confused"

*First recurring segment - animal stories*

```
[GRAPHIC: "ANIMALS BEHAVING NORMALLY, HUMANS CONFUSED"]

DANNY: It's time for our new segment: Animals Behaving
        Normally, Humans Confused. Where wildlife does
        wildlife things and humans lose their minds.

MAYA: First up: A 9-foot boa constrictor was removed from
        a Florida resident's yard. The homeowner called the
        sheriff, who sent a deputy to wrangle the snake.

        Because in Florida, that's just Tuesday.

DANNY: The deputy successfully captured the snake. No word
        on whether he put "snake wrangler" on his resume,
        but I hope so.

MAYA: Meanwhile, in San Francisco, wildlife authorities
        had to tranquilize a mountain lion wandering the
        streets of a residential neighborhood.

DANNY: In the city's defense, rent is expensive. That
        mountain lion probably couldn't afford Oakland
        either.

MAYA: And finally, in Colorado, wildlife officials rescued
        a bighorn sheep that walked onto a frozen river,
        fell halfway through the ice, and just... stayed there.

DANNY: Mood.

MAYA: The sheep is fine. Its dignity is not.

DANNY: That's "Animals Behaving Normally, Humans Confused."

## Headlines Block 2

### Story 4: British Two-Year-Old Breaks Pool Records

**Source:** UPI - Jan 28, 2026
**Lead:** Host 2

```
[GRAPHIC: "TODDLER POOL PRODIGY BREAKS WORLD RECORDS"]

DANNY: A two-year-old in England has broken TWO Guinness
        World Records for playing pool and snooker.

        He's not even three yet.

MAYA: I'm sorry, WHAT?

DANNY: This toddler — who presumably still needs help
        reaching the table — is now officially the
        world's youngest pool champion.

MAYA: I have been alive for decades and I still
        can't make a bank shot.

DANNY: This kid can't tie his shoes but he can run
        a table. Meanwhile, I can tie my shoes but
        I scratch on the break.

MAYA: What were you doing at two years old?

DANNY: Eating crayons, probably.

MAYA: Same.
```

### Rapid Fire Quick Hits

```
[GRAPHIC: "LOST DOG FOUND AFTER 4 YEARS"]
MAYA: A Wisconsin man drove across the country during a
        snowstorm to reunite with a dog he lost FOUR YEARS
        AGO in Philadelphia. Four years! That dog had a
        whole life in Philly.

[GRAPHIC: "CAPYBARA WINS BATH CONTEST"]
DANNY: In Japan, a capybara named Prune won a "long bath
        showdown" by staying in the water for over an hour.
        Which means someone organized a capybara bath
        competition, and I have questions.

[GRAPHIC: "CEILING COLLAPSES AT OKLAHOMA HOTEL"]
MAYA: Guests at an Oklahoma hotel filmed the ceiling
        collapsing in the dining area. Everyone's fine.
        The hotel's Yelp rating is not.

[GRAPHIC: "EMU STOPS TRAIN SERVICE"]
DANNY: And train service between Hull and Liverpool was
        interrupted by an escaped emu. British Rail called
        it an "unexpected wildlife delay." I'd call it the
        most British headline of the month.
```

## Sign-Off

```
MAYA: That's all for our first episode.

DANNY: To recap: A horse is crying, the President is fighting
        crime that's at a 30-year low, Dolly Parton is a donkey,
        there's a kangaroo loose in Texas, Batman showed up at
        a city council meeting, and a toddler is better at pool
        than both of us combined.

MAYA: 2026, everybody.

DANNY: We're in for a weird one.

MAYA: I'm Maya Chen.

DANNY: And I'm Danny Okonkwo.

MAYA: See you next week.

DANNY: When hopefully, the news makes sense.

MAYA: It won't.

DANNY: It won't.

BOTH: Good night!
