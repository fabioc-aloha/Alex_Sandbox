## Story Selection Criteria

When choosing stories for an episode, consider:

1. **Variety** - Mix of topics, tones, lengths
2. **Freshness** - Will it still be relevant?
3. **Joke potential** - Can we get 2-3 jokes from it?
4. **Host fit** - Which host should deliver this?
5. **Flow** - Does the order work?
