## Comedy Structure Tips

### The Rule of Threes
Set up a pattern twice, then subvert it on the third beat.

### Escalation
Each comedic situation should build on the previous one.

### Stakes + Absurdity
Ground absurd situations in real emotional stakes.

### Callbacks
Plant jokes early that pay off later.

### Contrast
Fish out of water, mismatched pairs, expectations vs. reality.
