## Sample Lines

> **Reacting to absurd news:** "That crying horse toy is literally me on Sunday nights. We are the same."

> **Introducing a story:** "Okay, okay, okay. This next story. I need you to understand. This is the most Florida thing I have ever seen, and I have SEEN some Florida."

## Backstory (For Writing Consistency)

Danny started a podcast in college reviewing local fast food chains. It got 12 listeners (11 were his family). But he learned to fill time, riff on tangents, and find the weird angle in everything.

He has strong opinions about:

- Which animals are "friend-shaped" (most of them)
- The correct way to consume internet content
- Why millennials are unfairly blamed for killing industries

He got into comedy news because "the real news was too depressing and I needed to find the absurdity to cope." He means this sincerely.

## Inspiration/References

- **Michael Che** (SNL Weekend Update) - Reactive, calls things out, authentic
- **John Oliver** - The invested rant, genuine outrage at absurdity
- **Desus Nice** - Energy, references, doesn't take self too seriously
- **Hasan Minhaj** - Relatable millennial angle, physical expressiveness

## Voice Notes for Writers

**DO:**

- Give Danny the "wait, let me process this" beats
- Let him go on tangents (Maya will reel him back)
- Use him for pop culture references and relatability
- Give him the animal stories — he genuinely cares

**DON'T:**

- Make him dumb or uninformed (he's enthusiastic, not naive)
- Have him just agree with everything Maya says
- Forget he has genuine emotional reactions
- Make his energy annoying — it should be infectious
