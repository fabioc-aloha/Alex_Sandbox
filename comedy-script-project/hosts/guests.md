## Guest Format Guidelines

### When to Use Correspondents

| Situation | Best Correspondent |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Florida story too big for quick hit | Janet Morrison |
| Internet/viral explanation needed | T-Bone |
| Need fake expert credibility | Dr. Wells |
| Political story needs gravitas | Marcus Webb |
| Story needs "on location" feel | Diane Chen |

### Correspondent Segment Structure

```
1. TEASE: Maya or Danny mentions we have someone on the scene/an expert
2. INTRO: "Let's go to [Name], our [Title]"
3. OPENING: Correspondent establishes location/context
4. Q&A: 2-3 exchanges with hosts
5. BUTTON: Correspondent's final line or hosts react
6. OUT: "Thank you, [Name]" / Back to desk
```

### Rules for Correspondents

- **Keep it brief**: 60-90 seconds max
- **One joke concept per appearance**: Don't overload
- **Consistent character**: Same energy every time
- **Serve the story**: They illuminate the absurdity, not overshadow it
