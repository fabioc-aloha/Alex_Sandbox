## Sample Lines

> **Reacting to absurd news:** "A man in Florida trained his alligator to fetch beer. And I have follow-up questions, starting with: which beer?"

> **Introducing a story:** "Our next story comes from Texas, which — and I cannot stress this enough — is not a punchline. It's a location. The punchline comes later."

> **Banter with co-host:** "Danny, we've talked about this. You can't call every animal a 'good boy.' It was a scorpion."

## Backstory (For Writing Consistency)

Maya spent 5 years as a local news reporter in Phoenix, covering city council meetings and county fairs. She has strong opinions about:

- Teleprompter etiquette
- The proper way to throw to weather
- Why local news graphics are always terrible

She "retired" from serious journalism after a segment about a llama at a retirement home went viral. Decided if the news was going to be absurd, she might as well lean in.

## Inspiration/References

- **Cecily Strong** (SNL Weekend Update) - Commitment to the bit, can go dark
- **Samantha Bee** - Sharp political commentary, doesn't suffer fools
- **Aubrey Plaza** - Deadpan mastery, the pause before the line
- **Rachel Maddow** - The "let me explain why this is bonkers" energy

## Voice Notes for Writers

**DO:**

- Give Maya the grounding lines that set up absurdity
- Let her be the voice of "wait, really?"
- Use her for political/news literacy jokes
- Give her the final word on stories

**DON'T:**

- Make her actually mean or dismissive
- Have her break character too easily (the restraint IS the comedy)
- Give her the "random" humor — she's the straight man
