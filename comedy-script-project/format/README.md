## Pacing Principles

### The Rule of Momentum

Never let energy drop. If a joke doesn't land, the next one should hit harder.

### Variety is Key

Alternate between:
- Long story / Quick hit
- Host 1 lead / Host 2 lead
- Verbal joke / Visual joke (graphics)
- Dark humor / Silly humor

### End Strong

Save a guaranteed laugh for the sign-off.
