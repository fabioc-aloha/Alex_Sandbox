## Writing Guidelines

### Joke Structure for News Desk

**The Classic Setup-Punchline:**
```
[NEWS] A man in Ohio was arrested for [absurd thing].
[JOKE] Which is still less embarrassing than [comparison].
```

**The React:**
```
[NEWS] Scientists discovered that [absurd finding].
[REACT] ...I mean, yeah. That tracks.
```

**The Callback:**
```
[NEWS] A Florida man [did something].
[CALLBACK] Making him the second-worst person in Florida this week, after [earlier story].
```

**The Tag:**
```
[SETUP + PUNCHLINE]
[BEAT]
[TAG] Also, [additional angle on same joke].
```

### Punching Up, Not Down

**Target:**
- Powerful institutions
- People who did absurd things BY CHOICE
- Systems, not individuals
- Yourself (self-deprecation)

**Avoid:**
- Marginalized groups
- Victims of the absurd situation
- Cheap stereotypes
- Punching down on everyday people

---

### Language and Tone

**Voice:**
- Conversational, not scripted-sounding
- Smart but accessible
- Absurdist, not mean-spirited

**Avoid:**
- Overly complex setups
- Inside jokes (unless callback)
- Explaining the joke
- Filler words

---

## Performance Guidelines

### Delivery

- **Pace:** Quick, but leave room for laughs
- **Eye Contact:** Look at camera for punchlines
- **Energy:** Slightly higher than natural
- **Reactions:** Stay engaged when co-host is speaking

### When a Joke Doesn't Land

1. Don't acknowledge it verbally
2. Move on immediately
3. Co-host can help with a small react
4. The next joke should be stronger

### Ad-Libs

- Encouraged between hosts
- Keep it brief
- If it's gold, keep going
- If it's dying, bail gracefully

---

## Visual Style

### Graphics

- Clean, news-style aesthetic
- Ironic contrast between serious format and absurd content
- Consistent branding

### Set/Background

- Traditional news desk setup
- Minimal distractions
- Good lighting on hosts

---

## Content Standards

### What Makes a Good Story?

✅ Verifiably true
✅ Inherently absurd

✅ Has a clear joke angle
✅ Won't be stale by air date
