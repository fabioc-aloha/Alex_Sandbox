## Segment Ideas

### "Really?!" / "Seriously?"

Host does extended rant about one particularly absurd story.

**Format:** 2-3 minute escalating disbelief monologue
**Best for:** Stories that are infuriating AND funny

---

### "Florida Man" / Regional Chaos

Dedicated segment for news from one consistently absurd location.

**Format:** Rapid-fire stories from one place
**Best for:** Building a running joke about that location

### "Corrections"

Sarcastically "correct" something from a previous episode.

**Format:** Read fake viewer complaint, give ridiculous "apology"

### The Desk Guest

A "correspondent" or "expert" joins the desk to discuss a story.

**Format:** Interview/banter with character

### "Headlines We Didn't Get To"

Rapid-fire joke headlines at the end (too weird to expand on).
