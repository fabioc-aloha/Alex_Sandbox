## Show Pillars

### The News is Real, The Commentary is Not

- Stories must be TRUE (verifiable absurd news)
- Commentary, reactions, and jokes are the creative content
- Never make up fake news - reality is absurd enough

### Quick Hits, Big Laughs

- Each story: 30-90 seconds max
- Setup → Punchline → Move on
- Rapid-fire energy keeps audience engaged

### Host Chemistry

- Banter between hosts is key
- React to each other, not just the camera
- Different perspectives create comedy
